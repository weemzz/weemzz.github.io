 									<h2>About Me</h2>
 								</header>
 								<p class="justify">My name is WeeM....that's all you should know about me. Then what im doing? it will be
								a long explanation. Anyway, we present a variety of programing and coding tutorials, and we provide
								various kinds of software such as Linux distro's in a disk, USB or other types of storage devices.
								Am I hijacking someone else's program? or open source software? Hold on there, im totaly not doing that, im just make it easier
								for you to get it without having to bother or take a long time to download, copying, installing and more. Another word,
								I actually helped developers to introduce their products to the public.
								For those who enjoy the complexity or learn about Software, Coding, programing, we provide various tutorials
								from anything we know.

								<h2>Who is WeeM</h2>
								<p>
									When i was a child, i really liked the assembled toys, and when grade 3 elementary school my talent began to look with cartoon scribbles,
									I used to apply it on the last sheet in a school notebook, so my teacher or brother didn't know it.
									I don't have a program education background, or Information Technology. Because in my time, there were no schools like that.
									In fact, we only know diskettes here when I am junior high school.
									<br />
									<br />
									Until a friend invited me to open a Web Development agent, he was very confident in my talent,
									even though I didn't have an idea how to turn on the computer. So I began to study through books on website development,
									so the business started running under the name MumtazMedia in Bandung, West Java, Indonesia. And we complete several tasks from the client.
									<br />
									<br />
									I also took part in training in Ane Ahira's AsianBrain for a year, so I was able to help SEO several times for some of my friends' sites. I also attended trainings at Udemy.
									then I did some freelance projects and assignments, not only creating or building websites, I also made logos, designs, and some other parts in this freelance.
									And now I still carry on web development freelance, either using CMS or using various frameworks.
									<br />
									<br />
									I also had study 3D and design with 3D master, who is currently at Ettihad company. I learned the basics of using 3D-Max, 3D learning principles,
									and various design components using Photoshop. Until I can make several complete room objects.
									I also learned the basics of 3D modeling using Blender, and practiced it for a while.
									<br />
									<br />
									I once had a hobby of jailbreaking iOS, and Rooting android with all the hassle, and the mess that I made to damage some devices,
									until I really mastered it, I really enjoyed it. With capabilities like that, it might not be difficult to develop other knowledge that is the same.
									So I studied and really enjoyed programming, coding, creating applications, until I sank into the world of UNIX, especially Linux.
									I learn alot thing about Linux, kernel, OS, hacking, Cyber Security.

										<h2>Insight and Inspiration</h2>
									</header>
									<p class="content">
									Muhammad Hamza Shahzad is the most youngest british-pakistani computer programmer, he's just 7-years, this is the news <a href="https://yourstory.com/2016/09/muhammad-hamza-shahzad/"><span class="bold">Muhammad Hamza Shahzad</bold></a>.
									Yuma Soerianto 11-years indoesian developer impressed the CEO of Apple, Tim Cook. He had started coding whenhe was 6.
									He even gave lessons for children in his youtube channel entitled Anyone Can Code. You can see his personal site with
									the impression of a child's joy madebyyuma . com. My point with some of these inspirational stories is to show how programing is as easy as pie,
									without degrading these talented little developers. Even if you see distress, it's only because of your POV. You only need to spend a few minutes a day,
									as a short time goes by, and you'll find your self being an expert. All you need is only "say hello" to coding, i mean Introduction, then the limit is your imagination.
									The important thing we have to know, in the world of programming there is no term wrong and right, beginner or master, because all have their own development, some use shortcuts, some use big roads.
									Let me prove that you can create a basic program for the site, follow the steps below, this only takes about five minutes.

										<h2>What should I do to start a business?</h2>
									</header>
									<p class="content">
									We can look for some big companion, what they exactly doing when they want open some store or show room,
									when they going to make a product, and any steps that we can apply in our business.
									Some great quotation from Mohammad Ali "If your dreams don't scare you, they aren't big enough",
									so lets made brand new days, make some big dreams, thats the first point. And the second point is, determination.
									It is a hard conditions, and the hardest step is to decide an idea. But, if we know how, then nothing to worry at all.
									The fun way to determine ideas is with <span class="bold"><a href="underconstruction.html">Market Research</a></span>. Third point is write down all your needs for that business into a paper,
									never keep your idea in your head, you will lose it. Breaking your mind as small part as you can, that called <span class="bold"><a href="underconstruction.html">Mind Mapping</a></span>.
									All the big company do that, And even, there are some special companies that work in that part, they are rented by big companies.
									They have some group of experts, sit together, they exchange ideas, it's called <span class="bold"><a href="underconstruction.html">Brain Storming</a></span>,
									then they start drawing it, thats the fourth point. Meanwhile, you can exchange ideas with friends or family, then you write down good ideas that you get.
									After this, you will feel the ease of starting a business.
