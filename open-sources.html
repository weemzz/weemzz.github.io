<h2>Am I selling <br>
			Freeware <span>Programs?</span></h2>

			The answer is NO. So why do I offer something that is open sources? Well, let's look at some minor difficulties in this process, complexity, 
			and length of time the operating system installation process, from search and matching according to the type of installation target, such as structure, 
			system type, then the download process,selection of the right boot media or portable storage, boot installation, partition settings that are very vulnerable problem, 
			and many other processes. For all these reasons, we offer the media such as USB that has been installed and set up, then you can easily use it. You only need to pay hardware, services, data charge, and all other necessities (don't worry it wouldn't be expensive). 
			But if you like with programming complexity, or some challange, there are many fundamental tutorials here, so let's take a shot.
