											 My name is WeeM....that's all you should know about me. Then what im doing?
											 it will be a long explanation. Anyway, we present a variety of programing and
											 coding tutorials, and we provide various kinds of software such as Linux distro's in a disk,
											 USB or other types of storage devices. Am I hijacking someone else's program?
											 or open source software? Hold on there, im totaly not doing that,
											 im just make it easier for you to get it without having to bother or take a long time
											 to download, copying, installing and more. Another word,
											 I actually helped developers to introduce their products to the public.
											 For those who enjoy the complexity or learn about Software, Coding, programing,
											 we provide various tutorials from anything we know. To contact me, please visit this link.

			<p class="marginAtas-30 main-txt">
				When i was a child, i really liked the assembled toys,
				and when grade 3 elementary school my talent began to look with cartoon scribbles, I
				 used to apply it on the last sheet in a school books.
				 I don't have a program education background, or Information Technology.
				 Because in my time, there were no schools like that. In fact, that time we only know diskettes, floppy disk.
				 There was a friend of an IT expert, invited me and one of my friends
				 to start a website development business.
				 he was very confident in my talent, even though I didn't have an idea
				 development, how to turn on the computer. He is my first great teacher. Then the journey began,
				 I to study all i needed from books and from online.
				 In short, the business started running under the name
				 MumtazMedia in Bandung, West Java, Indonesia.
				 And we complete several tasks from the client. It was a very pleasant experience.

				<b>Part One : </b>Initially I was in the interface design section, I could use Photoshop, Illustrator, Dream Weaver.
				How to make a beautiful look with many considerations.
				Then I began to study coding manually, in a short time I was able to make CSS and HTML coding perfectly.
				With this provision, I can develop knowledge about programming quickly. At that time I was interested in Javascript,
				and controlling databases like MySQL, phpmyadmin, MariaDB, online or offline with xampp or lampp.
<br>
<br>
				<b>Part Two : </b> Next I learned marketing techniques, this is the hardest part in my opinion,
				besides because this is the heart of the company, imagine, how do you offer bottled water
				in areas where every house has abundant water, and ironically, bottled drinking water is the best-selling product here.
				And worst part is, you have to wear a suit, tie and shiny shoes. It's like a horror movies for me. I always laugh at my friends who are in marketing.
				But karma has a foreign language, now I work freelance, which requires me to wear neat clothes, no more Captain Underwear.
				So, I feel more comfortable in the world of SEO, adsense, adword, you can do it even if you take off your shoes.
<br>
<br>
				<b>Part Three : </b>I also took part in training in Ane Ahira's AsianBrain for a year, so I was able to help SEO several times for some of my friends' sites.
				I also attended trainings at Udemy. then I did some freelance projects and assignments, not only creating or building websites, I also made logos, designs,
				and some other parts in this freelance.
				And now I still carry on web development freelance, either using CMS or using various frameworks.
<br>
<br>
				<b>Part Four : </b> I also had study 3D and design with 3D master, who is currently at Ettihad company.
				I learned the basics of using 3D-Max, 3D learning principles, and various design components using Photoshop.
				Until I can make several complete room objects. I also learned the basics of 3D modeling using Blender, and practiced it for a while.
<br>
<br>
				<b>Part Five : </b> I want to tell my little experience with unprofessional branch-company. Once upon a time, i start has little income from Adwords, Adsense, Amazon affiliates and others,
				because the site projects I'm working on are having problems, offers from Gopher marketing as partners running Adsense and Adword for project sites from my clients,
				who only pursue their targets regardless of the term in length, they always answer "can" on each of my questions,
				but after I make a payment they transfer the contact to the auditor's part, and the auditor answers my question with "can't".
				So I have to change the site immediately within 1 month, before the time I have submitted the new site address, but they answer "late",
				and the money cannot be returned. This is a lesson, never deal with an unprofessional branch-company. Just make a deal with central company.

									This is a suggestion that I got from my experience.
									you should start learning programming from HTML and CSS, because you will get a very useful base from here,
									but if you want programming for something else it can be done with an application or other learning programs.
									By learning how to create a website with HTML and CSS you will have very extensive knowledge,

																<br>
																	"<span class="horror-font">The wars that took place in the Anu country caused a prolonged monetary crisis. But with wisdom,
																		President Weem gave the best solution for his people, by subsidizing all sectors, and bringing in superhuman with steel

			<h2>Insight And <br>
		 <span>Inspirations</span></h2>
				<p class="marginAtas-30 justify">
					Let me introduce you, Muhammad Hamza Shahzad is the most youngest british-pakistani computer programmer, he's just 7-years,
					this is the news <b><a href="https://yourstory.com/2016/09/muhammad-hamza-shahzad/">Muhammad Hamza Shahzad</a></b>.
					Yuma Soerianto 11-years indoesian developer impressed the CEO of Apple, Tim Cook. He had started coding whenhe was 6.
					He even gave lessons for children in his youtube channel entitled Anyone Can Code. You can see his personal site with the
					impression of a child's joy <b><a href="http://www.madebyyuma.com/">madebyyuma.com</a></b>.
					<br />
					My point with some of these inspirational stories
					is to show how programing is as easy as pie, without degrading these talented little developers. Even if you see distress,
					it's only because of your POV. You only need to spend a few minutes a day, as a short time goes by, and you'll find your self being an expert.
					All you need is only "say hello" to coding, i mean Introduction, then the limit is your imagination. The important thing we have to know,
					in the world of programming there is no term wrong and right, beginner or master, because all have their own development, some use shortcuts, some use big roads.
					There's some video that motivated me from Toastmasters, Dananjaya Hettiaracchi
					<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbz2boNSeL0&t" target="_blank">There is Somethine in You</a></b>.
						And Mohammed Gahtani <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmX8FBNo2no&t" target="_blank">The Power of Words</a></b>.
					Let me prove that you can create a basic program for the site, follow the steps below, this only takes about five minutes.

	 				<p class="marginAtas-30 justify">
						We can look for some big companion, what they exactly doing when they want open some store or show room, when they going to make a product,
						nd any steps that we can apply in our business. Some great quotation from Mohammad Ali "If your dreams don't scare you, they aren't big enough", so lets made your brand new days,
						take a head, and make my day, thats the first point.
						<br />
						And the second point is, determination. It is a hard conditions, and the hardest step is to decide an idea. But, if we know how,
						then nothing to worry at all. The fun way to determine ideas is with <b>Market Research</b>, for the online market you can use Google Trends or Google keywords Tool,
						here some <b><a href="#">tutorial</a></b> to do that. Third point is write down all your needs for that business into a paper,
						never keep your idea in your head, you will lose it. Breaking your mind as small part as you can, that called <b>Mind Mapping</b>.
						<br />
						All the big company do that, And even,
						there are some special companies that work in that part, they are rented by big companies. They have some group of experts, sit together, they exchange ideas,
						it's called <b>Brain Storming</b>, then they start drawing it, thats the fourth point. Meanwhile, you can exchange ideas with friends or family,
						then you write down good ideas that you get. After this, you will feel the ease of starting a business.
