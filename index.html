      <h3>How to start Business</h3>
       <p class="marginAtas-10 justify">
	<b>First</b> point. <br>
	We can look for some big companion, what they exactly doing when they want open some store or show room, when they going to make a product,
	and any steps that we can apply in our business. Some great quotation from Mohammad Ali "If your dreams don't scare you, they aren't big enough", so lets made your brand new days,
	take a head, and make your day.
<br>
<br>
       <b>Second</b> point. <br>
  	And the second point is, determination. It is a hard conditions, and the hardest step is to decide an idea. But, if we know how,
	then nothing to worry at all. The fun way to determine ideas is with <i>Market Research</i>, for the online market you can use Google Trends or Google keywords Tool,
	here some <b><a href="#">tutorial</a></b> to do that.
<br>
<br>
	<b>Third</b> point. <br>
	Third point is write down all your needs for that business into a paper,
	never keep your idea in your head, you will lose it. Breaking your mind as small part as you can, that called <i>Mind Mapping</i>. All the big company do that, And even,
	there are some special companies that work in that part, they are rented by big companies. They have some group of experts, sit together, they exchange ideas,
	it's called <i>Brain Storming</i>, then they start drawing it, thats the fourth point. Meanwhile, you can exchange ideas with friends or family,
	then you write down good ideas that you get. After this, you will feel the ease of starting a business.

				 <h2>Insight And <br>
				<span>Inspirations</span></h2>
					 <p class="marginAtas-30 justify">
						 Let me introduce you, Muhammad Hamza Shahzad is the most youngest british-pakistani computer programmer, he's just 7-years,
						 this is the news <b><a href="https://yourstory.com/2016/09/muhammad-hamza-shahzad/">Muhammad Hamza Shahzad</a></b>.
						 Yuma Soerianto 11-years indoesian developer impressed the CEO of Apple, Tim Cook. He had started coding whenhe was 6.
						 He even gave lessons for children in his youtube channel entitled Anyone Can Code. You can see his personal site with the
						 impression of a child's joy <b><a href="http://www.madebyyuma.com/">madebyyuma.com</a></b>.
						 <br />
						 My point with some of these inspirational stories
						 is to show how programing is as easy as pie, without degrading these talented little developers. Even if you see distress,
						 it's only because of your POV. You only need to spend a few minutes a day, as a short time goes by, and you'll find your self being an expert.
						 All you need is only "say hello" to coding, i mean Introduction, then the limit is your imagination. The important thing we have to know,
						 in the world of programming there is no term wrong and right, beginner or master, because all have their own development, some use shortcuts, some use big roads.              					 
			    			Let me prove that you can create a basic program for the site, follow the steps below, this only takes about five minutes. 
						 Make a folder on your desktop, the name may be as you like. Open that folder, then create a txt file, I recommend using notepad. 
						 If you use Windows, right-click on the mouse, select create a new text file, then save, remove name and extension, replace with <b>index.html</b>, 
						 remember, don't save it in the txt extension, just type <b>index.html</b>.

				<p>
				We provide several types, such as a USB drive to install on your device, you can only use it to install, in contrast to the second type, 
				Persistant, where the software is installed on USB, so you only need to plug and turn on your computer to the boot options menu. 
				We also provide CDs, and for ARM type computers, we provide Micro SD cards.

				<p>
				The most important thing in the installation process is backup, just to be careful, unless there is no important data. 
				The next important process is to create Partitions, but this can be done during the install process.

			The answer is NO. So why do I offer something that is open sources? Considering the difficulties in this process, and from the needs of individuals, agencies, teachers, or anyone who needs them instantly, 
			then we offer an easy way by providing the media that has been installed some program or Operating System, and have been compiled. Then you can easily use it. 
			You only need to pay for hardware, data charge, and all other necessities (don't worry it wouldn't be expensive). 
			But if you like with programming complexity,or challange, there are many fundamental tutorials here, so let's take a shot.

    					<h3>Java Programming Language</h3>
    		  <p class="mar-10">
		    You must have heard the term Java in the world of computerization or programming. FYI, Java is a programming name that is still the most popular programming language in the world, and is still used today.
    			Many applications on your computer use java programming, like chatting app, some video on websites, and another application, and even on your smartphone.
    			<br />
    			<br />
    			The name Java is taken from the word Java, a province in <b>Indonesia</b>, and the Java logo is a cup of coffee, so this name describes <b>Javanese Coffee</b>, and that is the fact.
    			Then what is the relationship between the program and Java coffee? the information is not clearly known, but the strongest opinion said, programming made by James Gosling while in the company
    			Sun Microsystem (before being acquired by Oracle) was named Oak, a tree that grows outside his office, but the name already used by other companies,
    			so he changed his name to Java, considering he was a fan of <b>Javanese Coffee</b>. If they will change their names again, I suggest Sambosa, cos it's suitable to enjoy with Coffee, I guess so.
    			that's a brief history. Therefore, let us enjoy a cup of Javanese Coffee. <br /> <br />

    				How much you surf the internet? Youtube, Facebook, or other sites, or other programs that have to use the internet, well that has become a staple in this era.
    				Due to the fact, all of that is only 4% of the internet, the rest are in the Deep Web.
    				This is not nonsense, imagine how state intelligence delivers a very confidential message to his subordinates,
    				is it using Whatsapp, FB or Twitter? I don't think so. And some negative content such as human trafficking, body organs, or prohibited objects.
    				Or in the other case, have you ever heard about Wikileaks, founded by Jullian Assange, maybe you will get it in a normal browser,
    				but if you want to report something you have to visit the site on Deep Web. SilkRoad, a large marketplace that deals from sellers every year to $ 15 million, and continues to grow to $ 30 or 40 $.
    				What the hell they sell in hidden place? And now, facebook has open their site on deepweb, check this out https://facebookcorewwwi.onion/ but remember,

    				    <br />
    				There are at least 4.5 billion sites listed.
    				Deep Web is not always negative as many people expect, You can get many other uses there.
    				The average TLD (Top Level Domains like .com, .net, etc.) on sites in Deep Web is using .onion, with a random name, a combination of lowercase letters, large numbers and numbers,

			It's a <b>Trap</b>..!!</h2>
			<p class="marginAtas-30">
	Maybe you often hear someone genius, or a big figure
	who turns out to not complete his formal education, or is dropped out of college.
	Such stories are very frequent and even in all countries have some stories like that themselves.
	So, what happens to the world of education? Let me explain something.
<br>
	We just know, the brain has two parts of the workplace,
	right and left side, Left side is for logic, control, science, analytic, math, realistic. And another side is Right brain
	that contain passion, creativity, love, colorfull.
	Tragically, there are many incidents in people who die of their right brain, because of something very subtle, as smooth as the sound of ant's footsteps.
	the most important thing is education, many education systems are damaged but somehow they are
	still maintained, see how the development of cellphones, transportation, the state system,
	the buying and selling system, but you will not get a change in the education system for hundreds of years.
	How can a child who has an advantage in a matter be required to finish in a boring school and class for years which has
	absolutely no connection with his ability, the result, after he graduates he will lose the ability of his right brain in
	processing an advantage of himself, and his talent is over, thanks for the government.
<br>
	This is a lines of dissatisfaction from education that is in front of my eyes, the average that makes a bad boy is school,
	not from learning or teaching (although the curriculum is not based on improving the quality of students),
	but because of the environment and friends. and even I've experienced it for 12 years.
	Suppose, countries want to emulate the best education system, like Finland, or in Singapore.
	And we have to control the way we and our children use social media, because this is just as dangerous as drug abuse.
	Social media has an impact that drives Dopamine in a person's body. If it's excessive this substance can destroy the mental in a way that we don't realize.
	So let's build the future of our next generation by maximizing their outstanding talents and abilities, directed, not oppressed ...
	nurtured, not poisoned.
